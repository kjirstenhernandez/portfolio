It allows users to explore every domesticated cat breed in the world and provides a way to save favorite breeds using local storage. The site fetches breed data from The Cat API and dynamically loads pages, including a breed overview and a detailed page for each selected breed.\nCatlas also features a playful design, including a yarn mouse cursor and a JavaScript image carousel. \nBy creating this website, Iâ€™ve provided both an excellent reference for domesticated cat breeds and a visually enjoyable space where anyone can browse cat pictures whenever they need a serotonin boost."},

Users can create accounts secured through JWT authentication. Upon logging in, they can view their media shelf, add, edit, and delete media items, as well as filter and search through their collections. \n ShelfSpace is primarily written in C# using the Blazor framework, with Razor as the template engine. Development was done in Visual Studio Code. While we attempted to deploy the application using Azure, we were unable to make the site live and publicly accessible. \n This was a team project, and my contributions included implementing authorization and authentication, developing the "Create Account" page and its functionality, and debugging the "Add" and "Edit" features for individual media items.'},

It leverages React for the UI, MongoDB for the database, and was intended to use Next-Auth for authentication, though that component was never completed. Development was done in Visual Studio Code, and the application is deployed through Vercel. \n This was a team project, and my contributions included developing the "Manage Shop" page, implementing backend endpoints for profile information, creating the "Your Favorites" list wrapper on the profile page, designing the profile page UI, setting up datadabase creation and connection, and designing the logos and icons.'}
